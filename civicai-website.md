## **HOMEPAGE** (https://getcivicai.com/)

**Your Ads Drive Intent. Your Website Wastes It.**

Political campaigns are investing unprecedented sums in digital ads to attract high-intent supporters. Don't let a passive, one-size-fits-all website turn your largest growing investment into your biggest strategic leak.

**The Billion-Dollar Leak in Your Budget**

Campaigns are pouring money into sophisticated channels like Connected TV (CTV), with spending projected to increase by a staggering 506%. Yet, this firehose of expensive traffic is often directed at a website that isn't built to handle the surge. The result? A massive waste of resources. High bounce rates on key pages mean your ad dollars are evaporating. Potential supporters, motivated by your ad to learn more, leave your site without donating, volunteering, or signing up. Every lost visitor is a lost opportunity and wasted money.

## **IMPACT PAGE** (https://getcivicai.com/impact)

**From Strategic Vulnerability to Competitive Advantage**

In politics, every resource matters. CivicAI is engineered to ensure your largest growing investment—digital advertising—delivers a powerful strategic return.

**The Political "Digital Lag" is Costing You**

The commercial world has spent decades optimizing its digital strategy, recognizing that engagement is an "always-on" imperative. Yet the political sector often treats digital as a seasonal sprint, creating a profound strategic gap. This "digital lag" represents a massive vulnerability. High-intent visitors, driven by expensive ads, arrive at your site every minute. Without a proactive engagement strategy to meet them, their potential is lost, and your investment is squandered.

**The Value of Acquiring a Long-Term Asset**

The goal isn't just a one-time donation or a single volunteer shift. It's about acquiring a long-term supporter—a strategic asset for your campaign and your cause. A passive website lets these potential assets slip away. CivicAI is designed to capture them. By engaging visitors and converting them into known supporters, you're not just plugging a leak; you're building a sustainable base of support that provides value long after the first interaction. Every supporter captured is a direct return on your strategic investment.

**Turning Intent into Action**

**Attract**

You spend your budget on ads that drive high-intent traffic to your website.

**Engage**

Instead of a static page, CivicAI proactively starts a conversation, answering questions and understanding visitor needs in real time.

**Convert**

Based on the conversation, CivicAI presents the right call-to-action—a donation ask, a volunteer form, an event sign-up—turning a passive browser into an active supporter.

**Analyze & Adapt**

Gain unparalleled strategic intelligence. Our platform gives you a real-time, unfiltered view into the questions, concerns, and motivations of your most engaged supporters, expressed in their own words. Use this live focus group to sharpen your messaging, refine your strategy, and stay ahead of the narrative.

**From Wasted Intent to Captured Asset**

The campaign website is the final destination for nearly every digital ad, making it the single largest point of potential failure. Here is how CivicAI transforms that failure into success across your key channels.

**Digital Ad Channel | How a Passive Website Wastes Intent | How CivicAI Captures and Converts Intent**

**Paid Search** | A visitor with a specific question lands on a generic page, their query unanswered. | Proactively starts a conversation based on their search, providing instant answers and guiding them to the next step.

**Social Media** | A visitor arrives with emotional energy from a video ad, only to find a static form that kills the momentum. | Engages the visitor with contextual calls-to-action, turning emotional interest into tangible support like donations or sign-ups.

**Connected TV (CTV)** | A highly motivated viewer scans a QR code and is sent to a clunky, non-interactive mobile site. | Delivers an instant, mobile-first conversational experience that immediately converts this high-value traffic.

**Influencer Marketing** | A visitor arrives with a high degree of trust, only to find a generic homepage that breaks the narrative and erodes that trust. | Continues the specific conversation started by the influencer, maintaining narrative consistency and converting the trusted referral.

**See Your Potential**

Let us show you how CivicAI can turn your website traffic into the tangible assets you need to win.

## **PRICING PAGE** (https://getcivicai.com/pricing)

**An Investment in Growth, Not an Expense**

Stop thinking about cost. Start thinking about the value you're losing. CivicAI is priced to deliver a significant strategic return by converting your largest budget leak into your most valuable source of assets.

**The Real Cost is Your Wasted Ad Spend**

Your campaign is already spending hundreds of thousands, or even millions, on digital ads. How much of that investment is lost the moment a visitor hits your passive website and leaves? CivicAI is designed to capture that lost value. The investment in our platform is a fraction of the cost of the wasted ad spend you're already incurring.

**Your Breakeven Point? The First Supporter You Weren't Going to Get.**

Every new donor, volunteer, or advocate that CivicAI helps you acquire from your existing website traffic is a direct return on your investment. These are the supporters who would have otherwise clicked away, lost forever. By capturing just a handful of these lost opportunities, the platform provides immense strategic value. Everything after that is pure upside for your campaign.

## **ABOUT PAGE** (https://getcivicai.com/about)

"We saw campaigns spending a fortune to get voters to their digital front door, only to let them walk away. That isn't just a missed opportunity; it's a critical strategic failure. We built CivicAI to turn that point of failure into a campaign's most powerful asset."

**The Strategic Challenge: The Multi-Billion-Dollar Leak**

**The Political "Digital Lag" is a Catastrophic Waste of Resources**

Modern campaigns will spend over $3.5 billion on digital ads this cycle, yet they lag far behind the commercial sector in digital strategy. This "digital lag" creates a "leaky bucket" where massive ad spend attracts motivated supporters to passive websites that fail to convert them. Every visitor who leaves is a lost donor, a lost volunteer, and a direct drain on the finite resources you need to win.

**Our Solution: The ROI Engine for Modern Campaigns**

**Transforming Wasted Spend into Winning Assets**

CivicAI is the indispensable infrastructure for the modern campaign. Our platform is engineered to plug the "leaky bucket," converting the high-intent traffic you're already paying for into a sustainable base of supporters. We are an ROI engine that turns your largest growing expenditure into your most powerful source of new assets, all while providing the defensible, secure, and compliant platform that high-stakes environments demand.

**Automate to Reclaim Hours**

**Built for the Mission, Not Just the Moment**

CivicAI is not a generic business tool. It was purpose-built by campaign veterans to solve the three core anxieties of any campaign: a lack of Money, the fear of Mistakes, and the risk of Meltdowns. Our focus on asset acquisition, defensible message alignment, and operational resilience is a direct reflection of our deep understanding of what it takes to win.
